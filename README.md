WordPress, Git-ified. Synced via SVN!

This repository is My Forked version of the original mirror of the WordPress subversion repository.
It may contain my own patches and fixes, but will never be pushed back to the original repository.

So, please do not send any pull request. Submit patches to http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ instead.
